# Aerodynamics Analysis

Before learning how to do aerodynamics analysis in AeroSandbox, you should learn the math behind these concepts.

Mark Drela's "Flight Vehicle Aerodynamics" (which is the name of an MIT course, the accompanying textbook, and the EdX version of the course) is second to none - one of the most enlightening and entertaining classes of my academic career. Take a peek at the EdX version for free [here](https://www.edx.org/course/flight-vehicle-aerodynamics), or buy the textbook [here](https://smile.amazon.com/Flight-Vehicle-Aerodynamics-MIT-Press/dp/0262526441?sa-no-redirect=1) - it's worth every penny.

For a more mathematically exhaustive treatment, look at "Low-Speed Aerodynamics" by Katz and Plotkin.
