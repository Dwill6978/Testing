# AeroSandbox Tutorial
-----
Welcome to the AeroSandbox tutorial!

tl;dr: the first tutorial section is [available here](01%20-%20Optimization%20and%20Math/01%20-%202D%20Rosenbrock.ipynb).

Here's how this works:

* Read through the folders and files in ascending order. Upon opening any folder, be sure to read the `README.md` in the folder, if it exists.

* Every tutorial subsection is a Jupyter Notebook. You can either:

	* [View them on GitHub non-interactively](https://github.com/peterdsharpe/AeroSandbox/tree/master/tutorial) (easiest)

	* View them on your computer interactively (recommended). If you're new to Jupyter notebooks, [follow this tutorial here](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks).

* Each tutorial file is designed to take ~5 minutes to read through and will introduce you to several new features.

Happy reading!
