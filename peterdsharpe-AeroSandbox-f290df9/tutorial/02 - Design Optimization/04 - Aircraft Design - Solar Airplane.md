# Solar Airplane

For a practical example of more highly-detailed aircraft design optimization with thousands of variables and dozens of subsystems, see the AeroSandbox-based [Dawn Design Tool](https://github.com/peterdsharpe/DawnDesignTool).

This design tool is used for the design of high-altitude long-endurance (HALE) solar aircraft that fly for weeks or months at a time over regions of interest.
