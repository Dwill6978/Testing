AeroSandbox Documentation
=======================================

by `Peter Sharpe <https://peterdsharpe.github.io>`_ (<pds [at] mit [dot] edu>)

**AeroSandbox is a Python package for design optimization of engineered systems such as aircraft.**

At its heart, AeroSandbox is an optimization suite that combines the ease-of-use of familiar NumPy syntax with the power of modern automatic differentiation.

This automatic differentiation dramatically improves optimization performance on large problems: **design problems with tens of thousands of decision variables solve in seconds on a laptop**.

AeroSandbox also comes with dozens of end-to-end-differentiable aerospace physics models, allowing you to **simultaneously optimize an aircraft's aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, mission trajectory, stability, and more.**
