### Branch and Bound
Branch and bound method for regression. Minimizes the number of additive terms in the optimization equation to create parsimonious models. Creates branches based on whether to include a variable or not, and decides to explore/discard a branch based on calculating a lower bound. 

### Funtional Method
Method for creating more complex models. Represents each model as a tree, where each inner node is a function, and leaves are optimization variables or independent variables.
