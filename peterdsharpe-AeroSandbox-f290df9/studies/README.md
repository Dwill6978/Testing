# Studies

This folder contains studies where AeroSandbox models were generated. Usually, these consist of data-driven modeling of some sort, or reproductions of some scientific paper.

These studies are provided purely for reference - there are many places in AeroSandbox's documentation where it cites a study in this folder (e.g., "for more info, see /AeroSandbox/studies/SomeStudyName").

These studies may use out-of-date syntax and are purely here for methodology reference. They also may use other packages not included through a default `aerosandbox[full]` installation, so install these as-needed.

File formats you may see here:

* `.py` Python files
* `.ipynb` Jupyter notebooks
* `.m` Matlab files
* `.mlx` Matlab notebooks
